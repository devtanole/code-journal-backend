📝 Code Journal <br>
A full-stack journaling app that allows users to create, view, update, and delete personal entries. Each entry includes a title, notes, and an optional image uploaded through Cloudinary. The app features a clean UI, persistent storage via a backend database, and basic user authentication.

Note: This project was originally a pair project during my software engineering bootcamp. I later revisited it independently to refactor the codebase, clean up the UI, and implement final features such as image uploads and improved error handling.
